### Introduction
#### This project gives a demo of the Jasmine testing that can be incorporated to automate testing.
We will be writing a set of test suites for the existing code.


### Instructions
#### We have written 4 test suites
1. RSS Feeds, which checks to see if all
2. The menu
3. Initial Entries
4. New Feed Selection

That can be tested by loading the index.html file
